# Web Development Project 3 - *Number To Flashcards*

Submitted by: **Brian Huynh**

This web app: **This is a web app tool to learn what letters look like in words.  You can make an attempt to guess the word of the number and have the ability to shuffle through the cards.**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**
- [x] **Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect**
- [x] **A back button is displayed on the card and can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence**
- [x] **A next button is displayed on the card and can be used to navigate to the next card in a set sequence**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] A shuffle button is used to randomize the order of the cards

## Notes
Some of the challenges I faced while creating this project was figuring out how to determine if an answer was correct or incorrect.  Another struggle I had was figuring out how to shuffle, but I was able to figure it out using Math.random().
